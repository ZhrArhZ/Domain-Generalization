# Domain-Generalization
A collection of recent domain generalization papers (2022 onwards) with code and concise recommendations.

- **Open-set domain generalization (OSDG)**: <br>

  If you are encountering a problem where you may have samples from unknown classes in target domains and <br>
  you are looking for an OSDG method to handle this problem, since you don't want to simply use a one-vs-all <br>
  approach to detect unknown classes, this paper might be useful:
